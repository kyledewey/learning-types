\section{Introduction}
The previous handout considered a language which consisted only of expressions, no statements.
In this handout, we use fundamentally the same language, but use statements instead of expressions for \texttt{let} and \texttt{assign}.

\subsection{Language Used}
We'll first define the abstract syntax for our language, shown below:

\begin{gather*}
  x \in \mtt{Variable} \qquad i \in \mtt{Integer}
\end{gather*}
\begin{align*}
  \tau \in \mtt{Type} &::= \kw{int} \alt \kw{bool}\\
  e \in \mtt{Exp} &::= x \alt i \alt \kw{true} \alt \kw{false} \alt e_1 \;\&\&\; e_2 \alt e_1 + e_2 \alt e_1 < e_2\\
  s \in \mtt{Stmt} &::= \kw{let } x: \tau = e \alt x = e\\
  p \in \mtt{Program} &::= s \alt s \; p
\end{align*}

\noindent
Compared to the last handout, there are two notable changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{let} and assignment have been made into statements.
\item A program is now explicitly defined as either a statement, or a statement followed by another program.
  Phrased more simply, a program consists of one or more statements.
\end{itemize}
