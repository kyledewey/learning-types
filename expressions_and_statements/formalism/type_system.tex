\section{Type System}
Now that we have the syntax defined, we can define the language's type system.
Formerly, this entailed the definition of a single set of rules which operated over the language's expressions.
However, since we now have both statements and expressions, we need to define \emph{two} sets of rules: one for expressions and one for statements.
Both sets of rules will need type environments (expressions have variable access, and all statements currently involve variables), so we'll define that first:

\begin{align*}
  \Gamma \in \mtt{TypeEnv} &= \mtt{Variable} \to \mtt{Type}
\end{align*}

\noindent
Note this is the same type environment definition from last time; this is still a mapping of variables to types.

From here, we define the rules for expressions and statements in the subsections below.

\subsection{Rules for Expressions}
% Bascially the same as last time

\subsection{Rules for Statements}
% Statements modify the type environment instead of returning a type
