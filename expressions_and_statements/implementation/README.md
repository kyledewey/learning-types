# Typechecker for Expresions and Statements #

This is Scala code that implements a typechecker corresponding to the expressions and statements formalism.
To compile and run this, you'll need Scala and [`sbt`](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) installed.
You can compile and run the test suite like so:

```console
sbt # opens up sbt's console
sbt> compile
sbt> test
```
